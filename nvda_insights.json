          "reportTitle": "Which of the market-dominant and so-called \"Magnificent 7\" stocks might be the best investments? During the first phase of unbridled AI enthusiasm, all of the Mag 7 were loved as their opportunity appeared to be almost unlimited. The market is now more skeptical toward perceived AI winners, which has led to a natural tendency to rank the group on their go-forward prospects. We see Amazon moving up in the ranks, while Nvidia continues to command the top spot.  All the Mag 7 names have something in common. They are all dominant in at least one core competency; and they have leveraged the immense cash flows thrown off by their core competencies to invest in and develop the generative AI opportunity. \"Ranking\" the Mag 7 on their intermediate-term prospects, therefore, involves assessing each company's ability to defend and nurture its core business while using that strength to gain share within the AI ecosystem. For this week's list, we analyze and rank the Mag 7 (from top to bottom) on their apparent intermediate-term prospects. We expect our rankings for the Mag 7 to be fluid, but do not foresee any movement in first or last place.* Nvidia (NVDA): We continue to put Nvidia at the top of the Mag 7 list. Unlike the other six names, Nvidia's core competency is artificial intelligence. The need for realistic rendering in GPU-based gaming, Nvidia's founding business, laid the groundwork for the applications acceleration and the massively parallel computing that are cornerstones of training large language models (LLMs) and enabling inference. We rank Nvidia number one based on the evidence in the company's own growth numbers, which are stellar. In its recent fiscal 4Q25, revenue of $39 billion grew 78% annually. At its GTC event in March 2025, Nvidia forecast that data-center revenue would exceed $1 trillion annually in the next few years, and that the entire global industrial infrastructure represented a $50 trillion opportunity for AI renewal. Nvidia also provides much more than its industry leading GPUs, including its CUDA software library, and is \"turbo-charging\" agentic AI development with open-reasoning models, platforms, and partnerships. The best evidence of Nvidia's momentum is the growth of the enterprise infrastructure companies using Nvidia solutions to support the mainstreaming of AI. Micron's data-center revenue tripled year over year and now exceeds 50% of total company revenue. Micron increased the TAM for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) opportunity to $35 billion as of March 2025, up from $20 billion approximately half a year ago. Among the leading U.S.-based GPU server providers, Dell Technologies posted $10 billion in AI sever revenue in FY25 and expects $15 billion in FY26. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise exited fiscal 1Q25 with $8.3 billion in cumulative AI systems and services orders. The leaders in data center interconnects (DCIs), Broadcom and Marvell, are both reporting explosive growth in these categories. * Meta Platforms (META): Meta Platforms in second place because it has been among the most successful in leveraging its core competency (social media) into a leadership role in building LLMs, including multi-modal models. Snap has a limited opportunity, and X is stunted by self-inflicted wounds and perceived Musk contagion. Only Asia-based companies such as ByteDance (TikTok) represent a real threat. We see some risk to the core business from seemingly endless EU and U.S. congressional opposition; and Meta's social-media cornerstones (Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp) could be carved cleanly in three. We do not see that happening, however. Meta has successfully pivoted from the Zuckerberg's expensive obsession with the metaverse to the more-practical and fast-developing AI opportunity. Unlike AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, Meta is successfully enabling and advancing leading LLMs even though it is not a major provider of hybrid cloud services. We see Meta first and foremost deploying AI internally to improve operating efficiency and personal targeting so as to optimize the company's social media user base, which exceeds 3.3 billion. Facebook Reality Labs, which houses Meta's Gen AI business, posted revenue of $2.1 billion in 2024, just 1% of total Meta revenue. Currently, this is mainly a hardware-based business (Quest VR headsets, Ray-Ban AR glasses), but we see long-term growth opportunity as Meta's Llama LLMs go mainstream. Much as Apple capitalized on the vast iOS installed base and targeted the individual with iCloud, Meta could offer a personalized AI offering to its more-than three billion users.* Amazon.com (AMZN): In third place is Amazon. Amazon's online retail operations and particularly its Prime business are without a global peer. The combined retail operating margin (Americas and International) for 4Q24 was 6.1%, by far the highest in our model going back to company's inception. Prime's media is now rivaling Netflix in content quality and volume.  AWS is the leading CSP globally, and its rising margins and cash flows are funding the company's Gen AI opportunity. Amazon was quick to replace the head of AWS in May 2024 when the board perceived that the company was lagging in Gen AI. AWS is at a $110 billion annual revenue run rate and margins are at or near record highs. Both internally and in partnership with Anthropic and others, AI has produced Bedrock Marketplace, where clients can choose from over 100 LLMs; Trainium and Trainium 2 accelerators; and Amazon Nova, an extensive family of foundational models. * Apple (AAPL): Fourth place goes to Apple. Apple's core competency is global leadership in technology devices and services. Apple has been somewhat disappointing in its early efforts in AI. The company is even going outside its usual reliance on internal capabilities to enlist support from companies such as OpenAI. But we have long regarded Apple as a product perfector, not a product pioneer; early iteration mobile phones such as DynaTAC and StarTAC amazed, but they are long gone while iPhone grows in dominance. Investors are also concerned about Apple's declining China sales. Yet in the most-recent fiscal 1Q25, Apple grew revenue in all other regions. The company's massive iOS installed base exceeds 2.2 billion, providing fertile ground for continued growth in services.* Microsoft (MSFT): In the fifth spot is Microsoft. Microsoft has leveraged is core competency in enterprise software into Azure, the number two CSP behind AWS. Like all of the companies mentioned above that are not named Nvidia, Microsoft is challenged in getting sufficient supply of advanced Blackwell products to build and run its most-advanced models. Microsoft's cloud business has never been as profitable as AWS, although that may partly be due to which assets are allocated to the cloud division. Microsoft has had a few missteps in rolling out its Gen AI models, and both CNBC and Invezz recently questioned whether Microsoft was becoming an AI laggard. We note, however, that Microsoft Copilot has seen meaningful share gains and represents the first real threat to our sixth-place company.* Alphabet (GOOGL): Ranked sixth is Alphabet. Alphabet, of course, used to be named Google, and that name has been synonymous with internet search for decades. AI-assisted products such as Copilot and OpenAI's SearchGPT may be starting to cut into Google's search dominance. With many enterprises and consumers using Microsoft Edge as their browsers, Copilot \"conveniently\" pops up atop many searches. Google is seen as a pioneer in AI, created technologies underpinning early LLMs, and was a leader in the space until OpenAI exploded on the scene. After the hasty and flubbed Bard launch, Google Cloud has done much better with Gemini. Alphabet, like Meta, has been a particular target of U.S. and EU regulators. In August 2024, Alphabet was named a monopolist in a case brought by the Justice Department and 37 states. Breaking up Alphabet, however, would cleave the one big profitable business of Google Search and perhaps YouTube from all the expensive and unprofitable growth areas in Other Bets, including Waymo, Google Cloud, and the AI initiative. * Tesla (TSLA): At the tail end of the Mag 7 ranking is Tesla, whose core competency is electric vehicles. This space is becoming crowded, and China's BYD is much bigger and has developed fast-charging technology that is currently unmatched. The U.S. under President Biden sought to protect Tesla and U.S. EVs with massive tariffs on EV imports. Tesla CEO Elon Musk and President Trump are in sync, although the current president previously disparaged EVs in favor of internal combustion engines (ICE) vehicles. Tesla, like X (the former Twitter), is suffering some level of Musk contagion, although the number of users reselling their cars due to perceptions about Musk is not yet a major impediment. Instead, we see Tesla at risk from commoditization of EVs and competition from rivals, both domestic and foreign. While we did not incorporate valuation into our rankings, these companies are not hugely expensive due to the recent correction in growth sectors and the generally strong operating prospects for core businesses.",

Investors are also concerned about Apple's declining China sales. Yet in the most-recent fiscal 1Q25, Apple grew revenue in all other regions. The company's massive iOS installed base exceeds 2.2 billion, providing fertile ground for continued growth in services.* Microsoft (MSFT): In the fifth spot is Microsoft. Microsoft has leveraged is core competency in enterprise software into Azure, the number two CSP behind AWS. Like all of the companies mentioned above that are not named Nvidia, Microsoft is challenged in getting sufficient supply of advanced Blackwell products to build and run its most-advanced models. Microsoft's cloud business has never been as profitable as AWS, although that may partly be due to which assets are allocated to the cloud division. Microsoft has had a few missteps in rolling out its Gen AI models, and both CNBC and Invezz recently questioned whether Microsoft was becoming an AI laggard. We note, however, that Microsoft Copilot has seen meaningful share gains and represents the first real threat to our sixth-place company.* Alphabet (GOOGL): Ranked sixth is Alphabet. Alphabet, of course, used to be named Google, and that name has been synonymous with internet search for decades. AI-assisted products such as Copilot and OpenAI's SearchGPT may be starting to cut into Google's search dominance. With many enterprises and consumers using Microsoft Edge as their browsers, Copilot \"conveniently\" pops up atop many searches. Google is seen as a pioneer in AI, created technologies underpinning early LLMs, and was a leader in the space until OpenAI exploded on the scene. After the hasty and flubbed Bard launch, Google Cloud has done much better with Gemini. Alphabet, like Meta, has been a particular target of U.S. and EU regulators. In August 2024, Alphabet was named a monopolist in a case brought by the Justice Department and 37 states. Breaking up Alphabet, however, would cleave the one big profitable business of Google Search and perhaps YouTube from all the expensive and unprofitable growth areas in Other Bets, including Waymo, Google Cloud, and the AI initiative. * Tesla (TSLA): At the tail end of the Mag 7 ranking is Tesla, whose core competency is electric vehicles. This space is becoming crowded, and China's BYD is much bigger and has developed fast-charging technology that is currently unmatched. The U.S. under President Biden sought to protect Tesla and U.S. EVs with massive tariffs on EV imports. Tesla CEO Elon Musk and President Trump are in sync, although the current president previously disparaged EVs in favor of internal combustion engines (ICE) vehicles. Tesla, like X (the former Twitter), is suffering some level of Musk contagion, although the number of users reselling their cars due to perceptions about Musk is not yet a major impediment. Instead, we see Tesla at risk from commoditization of EVs and competition from rivals, both domestic and foreign. While we did not incorporate valuation into our rankings, these companies are not hugely expensive due to the recent correction in growth sectors and the generally strong operating prospects for core businesses."

          "reportTitle": "Tariffs Could Hit Differently this Time The second Trump presidency has moved faster than the first to enact significant policy changes that are reshaping the federal government, immigration policy, and a myriad of other areas. During his campaign, the president promised new tariffs. Some of these are now being rolled out, while others appear subject to negotiation.  Because the tariffs are mainly in a pending phase, economists have focused on other risks and opportunities from new policies. Immigration has been a major source of labor force growth in recent years, but fewer immigrants might keep unemployment low. The shake-out in federal employment has been devastating to those caught in the cross-hairs, but even big cuts in the federal workforce would return it to levels seen just a few years ago. Tariffs risk rekindling inflation, many economists agree, while noting that inflation is not a certainty. If companies are willing to absorb most of the higher costs, consumers may feel only moderate pain. If companies pass along most of the higher costs, consumers will see higher prices almost immediately.  Proponents note that the first round of tariffs enacted beginning in 2017 did not cause immediate inflation. Economists and scholars will long argue whether that first round had anything to do with the supply-chain crisis that ultimately contributed to inflation. The COVID-19 pandemic sits smack in the middle of this timeline and will forever complicate any clear analysis of the chain of events that ultimately led to the worst inflation in 40 years. The focus on the risks of tariffs triggering new inflation may be missing a larger point. U.S. consumers are still in the grip of existing inflation, and many consumers particularly in the lower tiers of the economy, appear tapped out. If tariff-sensitive companies decide to pass along the bulk of these costs rather than absorb them, instead of (or alongside of) rising inflation, we may see a slowdown in consumer spending. And with the consumer driving approximately 70% of U.S. GDP, that could send total GDP growth below the 2% level of 4Q24.  The Pre-2017 U.S. Consumer Argus President John Eade has identified the passage of Brexit, even more than the election of nation-first world leaders, as marking a key turning point in global relations and world trade. Prior to Brexit, much of the world was operating in a period of globalization that stretched back to the millennial turn or even before that. In this period, relatively free trade enabled developed countries such as the U.S. to effectively 'import deflation.' U.S. consumers benefited from relatively inexpensive goods, with prices that often were lower than those for the goods they displaced. The other price paid was steep, as high-quality jobs were lost to overseas relocation.  The consumer price index captures this benign pricing environment. In 2000, the Consumer Price Index was 172.2 (the baseline was established at 100 in 1982). By 2024, the CPI was 313.7. Using a simple compound average annual growth rate (CAGR) calculation, the CPI appreciated at an average 2.5% annual rate over the 2000-2024 period.  In the decade preceding the first tariffs in 2017, the consumer really had it easy. From 215.3 in 2008 to 245.1 in 2017, the CPI grew at a 1.5% CAGR. The Great Recession is at the beginning of this period and, like COVID-19, introduces a knotty complication into the calculation. The main point is that inflation in this period averaged a full half-percentage point below the Fed's 2% long-term target range.  As noted, the period following 2017 included the supply-chain crisis and a global pandemic, culminating in withering inflation. From 245.1 in 2018 to 313.8 in 2024, the U.S. consumer price index grew at a 3.6% CAGR. That includes some relatively benign years such as 2020 (1.2% CPI growth) and some really nasty periods such as 2022 (8.0% CPI growth). The point is that goods and services prices are up substantially from the last time America embarked on a significant round of tariffs. The 2025 Consumer Every U.S. consumer has felt the pressure of inflation over the past five or six years. Those on the bottom are feeling it more, however. The bifurcation between the upper half of consumers and the lower half has never been more pronounced. And the culprit once again is inflation. Any Economics 101 textbook likely explains inflation by examining what it does to goods prices. The inflation that kicked into high gear in 2022 has been characterized by particularly severe and sticky services inflation. Rents have gone up severely (and continue to rise), representing a larger and larger chunk of renters' take-home pay. Prices for all kinds of insurance, including vehicle insurance, have appreciated more and faster than overall inflation. Price for food and other necessities are also up sharply. Lower-tier consumers are severely strained by this burden and have less and less available for discretionary spending, from restaurant meals to laptops.  If you go to Walmart for a first-hand glimpse of this reality, you might be surprised at all the nice new cars in the parking lot. Walmart has been gaining higher income shoppers in recent years, and the trend appears to be accelerating. In May 2024, Walmart CEO John Rainey noted that the chain was seeing growth across income cohorts, 'with upper-income households continuing to account for the majority of share gains.' Walmart defines upper-income as households with more than $100,000 in income.  That trend was also evident when the company reported 2024 holiday-quarter sales in mid-February 2025. Walmart management also warned that it expected fiscal-year profit growth to slow, as the company would not be 'immune' from tariffs on Mexico and Canada. Upper-income consumers flocking to Walmart is a sign that no consumer is immune to the damage done by inflation. Enactment of new 10%-25% or even higher tariffs on major trading partners risks causing a slowing in consumer spending across the board.  Conclusion While there is no certainty on the timing and magnitude of tariffs here and worldwide, we expect impacted companies to respond with agility and flexibility as a means of maintaining business activity levels and retaining customer relationships. The practical implication is that companies will 'eat' some portion of tariffs, to the detriment of margins.  Multiple factors could mitigate the worst impacts, however. The first round of tariffs, the pandemic, and the supply-chain crisis all awakened Americans to the need to lessen reliance on outsourcing and to bring production of goods closer to home. The CHIPS & Science Act has encouraged the on-shoring of U.S. technology production, and the Inflation Reduction Act has used government resources to encourage domestic production of green energy solutions.  We continue to monitor risks and opportunities in the economy related to meaningful policy changes. Our base case remains that the economy will continue to grow in the low-2% range, unemployment will remain relatively close to current levels, and S&P 500 earnings growth will accelerate in 2025 from 2024 levels. Putting that all together, we believe the S&P 500 can appreciate in the 'normal' 8%-12% range in 2025, with leadership potentially shifting away from traditional growth sectors and toward cyclical, income-sensitive, and defensive sectors.",

CPI was 2.9% in December on an annual basis and core CPI was 3.2%. Argus forecasts no change in CPI and we expect core CPI will tick down to 3.1%. For our Economic Call of the Week, Argus Chief Economist Chris Graja, CFA, offers the following. 'We normally try to highlight indicators that aren't widely followed or provide a different perspective on the economy, but this week it will be all about inflation, with consumer prices on Wednesday and producer prices on Thursday. One reason we are focusing on inflation over retail sales (due Friday) is that inflation expectations jumped in the University of Michigan's sentiment reading last Friday. One-year inflation expectations rose by a full point to 4.3% in February from 3.3% in January. The three-month average through December had been 2.8%. Retail sales will still be important. Our big concern is always the health of consumer spending. We expect the data will confirm that consumers are continuing their strong pace of spending, as unemployment is low and wages are growing. Wealthier consumers are in especially good shape and they count for a higher percentage of spending. However, we note that January of 2024 was the weakest month in 1Q24, and we would not be surprised or overly concerned if consumers take a bit of a pause.'  Last week, mortgage rates dipped six basis points (bps), with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage now at 6.89%, according to FreddieMac. Gas prices fell two cents to an average of $3.08 per gallon for regular gas. The Atlanta Fed GDPNow indicator is forecasting for 1Q and calls for expansion of 2.9%. For 2025, the Argus GDP estimate is for 2.1% growth. The Cleveland Fed Inflation Nowcast is forecasting for February and is at 2.62%, which is lower than expectations for January. The next Fed rate decision is on March 19, with odds currently at 17% for a rate cut, according to the CME FedWatch rate tool. After that, the next meeting is in early May.",

          "reportTitle": "Inflation Data Unwinds Some of the Post-Election Rally Stocks soared on 11/6/24 on investor optimism that the incoming Trump administration would issue business-friendly policies including relaxed regulations and additional tax cuts. The rally has since partly reversed, however, on still warm inflation data that underscores the difficulty in getting to the Fed's 2% inflation. Investors are also assessing the risk that new higher tariffs, cuts on income taxes on overtime and Social Security, and deportation of low-wage workers might reverse inflation progress to date.   The clear Trump victory and House and Senate sweep mean that the president will have legislative support to enact his agenda. The CPI and PPI reports suggest that inflation could remain an ongoing challenge for the new administration.  October CPI and PPI On 11/13/24, the Bureau of Labor Statistic within the Labor Department reported that the all-items consumer price index (CPI) for October increased 0.2% on a month-over-month basis. That increase was in line with both the September increase and with the consensus forecast for October. While 0.2% was expected, investors are frustrated that the monthly change has not ticked down to 0.1% or even 0.0%. Investor concerns centered on the annual change of 2.6% in consumer prices. The annual change matched the 2.6% consensus call but represented an increase from the 2.4% annual change reported for September 2024. Excluding food and energy, 'core' CPI rose 0.3% month over month and 3.3% year over year. Both the monthly change and the annual change in core CPI were in line with consensus expectations and level with prior-month readings.  Producer prices capture data from further up the production chain and may indicate what consumers will face in coming months. While the CPI readings showed inflation stalled in place, the producer price index (PPI) indicated some backsliding on prices.  For October, the all-items PPI rose 0.2%. Although that was in line with consensus, it was worse than the revised September PPI change of 0.1% (originally reported as 0.0%). On a year-over-year basis, the October all-items PPI rose 2.2%. That was a tick better than the 2.3% consensus forecast but was up from a revised 1.9% annual change for September (originally reported as 1.8%).  There are two variants on core PPI: excluding food and energy, and excluding food, energy, and trade services. Ex food and energy, core PPI for October was up 0.3% month over month and 2.3% year over year. These changes represented higher monthly and annual inflation than was reported in September while matching pre-reporting consensus expectations.  PPI excluding food, energy and trade services was up 0.3% monthly and 3.5% annually; both were worse than the 0.2% monthly change and the 3.2% annual change reported for September. Investor Takeaways Investors had two key takeaways from the CPI and PPI data, both all-items and core. The first was a reminder that getting through the 'last mile' of inflation to the Fed's 2% target remains challenging. Consumer inflation peaked at 9.1% in June 2022. The decline from that peak was initially rapid, but progress on inflation has been difficult to measure in the recent months and even the past year. The annual change in the October 2023 CPI was 3.4%, meaning it has taken a year to whittle inflation down by about one percentage point.  The most stubborn components in October CPI remain related to services. According to the BLS, the index for shelter (meaning rents and rent equivalents) within the CPI rose 0.4% month over month and accounted for more than half of the monthly all-items increase.  Shelter not only remains stubbornly elevated; it accounts for nearly one-third of the total consumer price index. Other CPI components have a smaller weighting but showed a worse trend. Used car and light truck prices unexpectedly shot higher by 2.7% from September, after posting negative changes over the June-August period. Another non-goods component, electricity services, rose 1.2% for October; this category too was subdued in the summer months.  The second key takeaway is that neither the PPI nor the CPI is likely to prevent the Fed from enacting a 25-bps rate cut at its December meeting. But investor conviction that the Fed will end the year with a quarter-point cut is by no means as strong as it was a month ago. The Fed cut rates by 50 basis points (bps) at its September meeting and by 25 basis points at its October meeting. The October cut brought the central tendency in the fed funds rate to 4.5%-4.75%. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is scheduled to conduct its final meeting of the year on December 17 and 18.  According to the CME Fed Watch tool as of 11/18/24, the probability of a 25-bps cut at that meeting is 58%. The probability of the Fed leaving rates unchanged is 42%. No other outcome - a shock rate hike, or a 50-bps cut - earned even a percentage point of probability. A month ago, the probability of a 25-bps cut at that meeting was 77%; and the probability of no cut was 22%. The Industrial Economy: Sentiment vs. Reality Recent data from the industrial economy supports the view that manufacturers would benefit from a lower rate environment. Industrial production for October slipped by 0.3%, after declining by the same amount in September. Industrial production aggregates manufacturing, mining and utility output. This indicator has softened in 2024 mainly due to weakness in mining, reflecting depressed demand from the world's biggest commodity consumer (China), and mixed trends in utility output due to mild weather.  In October, both utility (up 0.7%) and mining output (up 0.3%) ticked higher, but manufacturing output declined by 0.5%. The Federal Reserve board, which reports this data, pointed out that industrial production in October was suppressed by a strike at a major aircraft producer (Boeing) and by the aftermath of Hurricanes Milton and Helene. The Industrial Production index was 0.3 percentage point below its year-earlier level. Capacity Utilization of 77.1% for October was 2.6 percentage points below its long-run average. Factory orders for September were also impacted by the Boeing strike, declining 0.5%. Whereas actual activity in the industrial sector has been tepid, the election appears to have unleashed business optimism. The Empire State Manufacturing index was the first sentiment index to at least partially capture post-election sentiment. The index shot higher to 33.2 for November, from negative 11.9 for October; the consensus forecast for this series was 0.0%. The National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) reports its small business optimism index in the second week of December. This index, most recently at a depressed 93.7, is also expected to shoot higher on positive sentiment toward the change in administration.  Conclusion The S&P 500 closed above 6.000 for the first time on 11/11/24. The index has since walked back to the around 5,900 as investors assess what the incoming administration means for the economy, interest rates and inflation.  Changes in policies under a new administration risk rekindling inflation, but it is far too early to say what the actual impacts will be. Improving business sentiment could coincide with an improvement in actual economic activity amid recovery from the strike and storms impacts of recent months.  Argus forecasts healthy spending in the holiday season, reflecting a fully employed workforce and slightly rising wages. While the stock market may not end the year at its highs, there is little reason to believe that recent moderation off the highs will lead to deeper selling.",

The CPI and PPI reports suggest that inflation could remain an ongoing challenge for the new administration.  October CPI and PPI On 11/13/24, the Bureau of Labor Statistic within the Labor Department reported that the all-items consumer price index (CPI) for October increased 0.2% on a month-over-month basis. That increase was in line with both the September increase and with the consensus forecast for October. While 0.2% was expected, investors are frustrated that the monthly change has not ticked down to 0.1% or even 0.0%. Investor concerns centered on the annual change of 2.6% in consumer prices. The annual change matched the 2.6% consensus call but represented an increase from the 2.4% annual change reported for September 2024. Excluding food and energy, 'core' CPI rose 0.3% month over month and 3.3% year over year. Both the monthly change and the annual change in core CPI were in line with consensus expectations and level with prior-month readings.  Producer prices capture data from further up the production chain and may indicate what consumers will face in coming months. While the CPI readings showed inflation stalled in place, the producer price index (PPI) indicated some backsliding on prices.  For October, the all-items PPI rose 0.2%. Although that was in line with consensus, it was worse than the revised September PPI change of 0.1% (originally reported as 0.0%). On a year-over-year basis, the October all-items PPI rose 2.2%. That was a tick better than the 2.3% consensus forecast but was up from a revised 1.9% annual change for September (originally reported as 1.8%).  There are two variants on core PPI: excluding food and energy, and excluding food, energy, and trade services. Ex food and energy, core PPI for October was up 0.3% month over month and 2.3% year over year. These changes represented higher monthly and annual inflation than was reported in September while matching pre-reporting consensus expectations.  PPI excluding food, energy and trade services was up 0.3% monthly and 3.5% annually; both were worse than the 0.2% monthly change and the 3.2% annual change reported for September. Investor Takeaways Investors had two key takeaways from the CPI and PPI data, both all-items and core. The first was a reminder that getting through the 'last mile' of inflation to the Fed's 2% target remains challenging. Consumer inflation peaked at 9.1% in June 2022. The decline from that peak was initially rapid, but progress on inflation has been difficult to measure in the recent months and even the past year. The annual change in the October 2023 CPI was 3.4%, meaning it has taken a year to whittle inflation down by about one percentage point.  The most stubborn components in October CPI remain related to services. According to the BLS, the index for shelter (meaning rents and rent equivalents) within the CPI rose 0.4% month over month and accounted for more than half of the monthly all-items increase.  Shelter not only remains stubbornly elevated; it accounts for nearly one-third of the total consumer price index. Other CPI components have a smaller weighting but showed a worse trend. Used car and light truck prices unexpectedly shot higher by 2.7% from September, after posting negative changes over the June-August period. Another non-goods component, electricity services, rose 1.2% for October; this category too was subdued in the summer months.  The second key takeaway is that neither the PPI nor the CPI is likely to prevent the Fed from enacting a 25-bps rate cut at its December meeting. But investor conviction that the Fed will end the year with a quarter-point cut is by no means as strong as it was a month ago. The Fed cut rates by 50 basis points (bps) at its September meeting and by 25 basis points at its October meeting. The October cut brought the central tendency in the fed funds rate to 4.5%-4.75%. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is scheduled to conduct its final meeting of the year on December 17 and 18.  According to the CME Fed Watch tool as of 11/18/24, the probability of a 25-bps cut at that meeting is 58%. The probability of the Fed leaving rates unchanged is 42%. No other outcome - a shock rate hike, or a 50-bps cut - earned even a percentage point of probability. A month ago, the probability of a 25-bps cut at that meeting was 77%; and the probability of no cut was 22%. The Industrial Economy: Sentiment vs. Reality Recent data from the industrial economy supports the view that manufacturers would benefit from a lower rate environment. Industrial production for October slipped by 0.3%, after declining by the same amount in September. Industrial production aggregates manufacturing, mining and utility output. This indicator has softened in 2024 mainly due to weakness in mining, reflecting depressed demand from the world's biggest commodity consumer (China), and mixed trends in utility output due to mild weather.  In October, both utility (up 0.7%) and mining output (up 0.3%) ticked higher, but manufacturing output declined by 0.5%. The Federal Reserve board, which reports this data, pointed out that industrial production in October was suppressed by a strike at a major aircraft producer (Boeing) and by the aftermath of Hurricanes Milton and Helene. The Industrial Production index was 0.3 percentage point below its year-earlier level. Capacity Utilization of 77.1% for October was 2.6 percentage points below its long-run average. Factory orders for September were also impacted by the Boeing strike, declining 0.5%. Whereas actual activity in the industrial sector has been tepid, the election appears to have unleashed business optimism. The Empire State Manufacturing index was the first sentiment index to at least partially capture post-election sentiment. The index shot higher to 33.2 for November, from negative 11.9 for October; the consensus forecast for this series was 0.0%. The National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) reports its small business optimism index in the second week of December. This index, most recently at a depressed 93.7, is also expected to shoot higher on positive sentiment toward the change in administration.  Conclusion The S&P 500 closed above 6.000 for the first time on 11/11/24. The index has since walked back to the around 5,900 as investors assess what the incoming administration means for the economy, interest rates and inflation.  Changes in policies under a new administration risk rekindling inflation, but it is far too early to say what the actual impacts will be. Improving business sentiment could coincide with an improvement in actual economic activity amid recovery from the strike and storms impacts of recent months.  Argus forecasts healthy spending in the holiday season, reflecting a fully employed workforce and slightly rising wages. While the stock market may not end the year at its highs, there is little reason to believe that recent moderation off the highs will lead to deeper selling."

But that ride re-accelerated after hours as OPEC cut its demand outlook and fears lessened about energy facilities being targeted as part of Middle East hostilities. After falling to an October 1 intraday low of $66.33, oil had surged to an October 8 intraday high of $78.46. But WTI dropped to an intraday low $71.53 the next day, and then rebounded to $76.24 by October 10. With that rally, WTI had broken some shorter-term bearish trendlines and completed a bullish false breakdown.  But as evidenced by events over night, the worry for any intermediate-term bullish call on oil is the lack of positive demand and supply news. And while it's hard to believe things will quiet down in the Middle East in the near term, crude could move even lower when hostilities do calm. As we've said, the COT data for WTI is technically bullish. But mid-October to early December has been the worst time for oil over 40 years.     The SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) ETF has moved sideways since September 26 and appears to be tracing out a bull flag. The reversal in the dollar and interest rates that started in mid-September has not hurt gold and silver so far; once again, the metals are ignoring a rising currency.

That said, international stocks offer favorable near-term valuations, and we target 5%-10% of equity exposure to the group. In terms of growth and value, growth has rebounded in 2024, outperforming value as interest rates have stabilized.  Over the longer term, we anticipate that growth, led by the Tech and Healthcare sectors, will top returns from value, led by the Energy and Materials sectors, due to favorable secular, demographic and regulatory trends."

          "reportTitle": "Rate-Cut Rotation August has a reputation as a sleepy time in global stock markets, and the U.S. is no exception. Particularly in the second half of the month, investors head off to the mountains or the beach; trading desks are lightly staffed; and phone calls tend to dwindle. Little surprise that August on balance is an inconclusive month: since 1980, the S&P 500 has averaged a flat performance for the eighth month. There are outliers in both directions, of course, with big gains in 1982, 2002, and 2020; and big losses in 1990, 1998, and 2011. A Frantic August 2024 With one trading week remaining as we prepared this article, the S&P 500 was up about 2% for August 2024. While that number or something like it will be put in the ledger sheet, this August was uncommonly tumultuous. On the final trading day of July, the S&P 500 closed at 5,522. A deeply below-consensus July nonfarm payrolls number sent stocks tumbling, and by 8/5/24, the index was 6% below that level at 5,196. The suddenly popular perception was that the Fed, after badly missing the onset of inflation two-plus years earlier, had held rates too high for too long and was now allowing the economy to slip into recession. The panicky selling in the market belied other evidence that the economy was okay, if not exactly roaring. Second-quarter 2024 GDP grew 2.8%, double the growth rate reported for the first quarter. In addition, second-quarter S&P 500 earnings from continuing operations increased year-over-year in low double-digits, for the strongest growth in nine quarters. Simultaneously, there are rifts in the consumer and business economies, because goods and services have been too expensive for too long.  As of the beginning of August's final trading week, the S&P 500 had climbed back to within a percentage point of its all-time high. Fed Chair Jay Powell used the forum of this year's Jackson Hole Economic Symposium to allay recession fears. In his calm and reassuring speech, the Fed Chair stated that the 'time has come' to cut interest rates in response to cooler inflation and slowing economic growth. Inflation has 'declined significantly,' he added, and the labor market 'is no longer overheated.'  Perhaps most notably, Fed Chair Powell acknowledged, 'the balance of risks to our two mandates has changed.' Inflation is receding, and the mandate to return inflation to 2% has nearly been met. At the same time, the economy has softened from recent peaks, and the mandate to maintain maximum sustainable employment is now at risk.  Reversals in Fed policy, and particularly the move from raising rates to cutting rates, inevitably come at a fraught time for the economy. In those periods, the economy is seen as vulnerable to too little stimulus, while inflation is at risk of returning from too much stimulus. The Fed Chair's calm tone in addressing the dual mandate, in our view, was a necessary lubricant in the shift from restrictive to accommodative monetary policy. The market response - an 8.4% rally in the S&P 500 off the 8/5/24 lows, to 5,635 at the 8/23/24 close - suggests that investors broadly feel that the Fed in this cycle has successfully navigated the transition from fighting inflation to sustaining employment and economic growth.  New Favored Sectors Emerge The August gain in the S&P 500 will go in the books as a single number: the markets recovered, good job, and on we go. Beneath the surface, the market in August - and in an equally tumultuous July - has been undergoing a meaningful transition at the sector level. Investors' nearly two-year fascination with AI stocks has not gone away, but it has moderated somewhat. And AI stock winnings may now be a vital source of funds for investing in other areas perceived as timely in the currently unfolding interest-rate environment. During the third quarter to date, the two best-performing sectors have been Utilities and Real Estate. With one trading week left in August, the iShares Real Estate ETF IYR is up 14% for 3Q24; and iShares Dow Jones US Utility ETF is up 10%. Both sectors are perceived as sensitive to interest rates, and both have historically moved into favor when market rates of interest are declining. When Treasury and fixed-income yields begin to decline, some portion of bond investors rotate into stocks in pursuit of income provided by high-yield equity sectors. The rotation into Utilities and Real Estate stocks sends prices higher, causing yields to come down (assuming no change in dividend policy) as stock prices come up. Yields on Utilities and REIT, whether rising or falling, thus maintain a floating but relatively consistent differential with bond yields. We looked at Utilities sector performance across an approximately 20-year span dating back to the turn of the millennium. In an 11-sector index, we differentiate between a top-five finish (top-five performing sectors in any year) and a bottom-five finish (worst performing five sectors in any year). Utilities had top-five sector performances in 2007, 2008, 2011, 2014, and 2018, when interest rates were declining. Utilities had bottom-five performances in 2020, 2021, and 2023, when interest rates were rising.  Digging into the details from some of those years, Utilities were the third-best sector in the S&P 500 in both 2007 and 2008. The 10-year Treasury yield went from 4.8% on January 1, 2007, to 2.4% by December 31, 2008. Arguably, investors had other things on their minds in 2008, such as the Great Recession. Nevertheless, rotation into defensive sectors in troubled times is also a persistent theme. In 2011, which was not a particularly volatile time in the economy, Utilities were the best sector in the S&P 500. In that year, the 10-year year Treasury yield went from 3.4% on January 1, 2011, to 2.0% on December 31. Utilities were the second-best sector in 2014, as the 10-year year Treasury yield went from 2.8% on January 1, 2014, to 2.1% on December 31. Finally, Utilities were the second-best sector in 2018. Over a two-year span, the 10-year Treasury yield went from 2.5% on January 1, 2018, to 1.7% on December 31, 2019.  We do not have the same clear signal from Real Estate, given that the stocks were not broken out from the S&P Financial Sector until 2016. Additionally, whereas Utilities are monopolistic and regulated, Real Estate stocks operate in multiple industries spanning retail shopping, commercial real estate, doctors' offices, rental apartments, and more. Still, the performance of the two leading sectors in 3Q24 signals that the financial markets have fully embraced the reality and immanence of Fed rate cuts. Other sectors that are top-5 in 3Q24 include Financials Healthcare, and Industrial; all are up in the 7%-8% range for the quarter to date. Financial stocks such as banks would seem vulnerable to compression in net interest margins as rates come down. But the bigger outcomes from lower rates are the expected revival in commercial & consumer loans, including mortgages, and strengthening in fee-based businesses such as credit financing, IPOs, and M&A.  Healthcare stocks are expected to benefit as lower interest rates take some of the strain off consumer finances, enabling more discretionary and high-return medical procedures (i.e., new hips and knees). Industrial stocks are dependent on business-to-business (B2B) transactions and thus benefit from lower financing rates on major deals.  The bottom-five sector stocks in 3Q24 include two of this year's big winners: Information Technology and Communication Services. Both are up in the 1%-2% range for 3Q24, despite being up 22% and 20%, respectively, for all of 2024 to date. Two of the other laggards, Energy and Materials, are close to flat in the year-to-date, as the malaise from China (which is partly demographic in nature) overhangs all parts of the commodities complex. Consumer Discretionary was among the bottom two sectors (along with Real Estate) in the first half. Given prospects for lower rates helping the housing and automotive segments, Consumer Discretionary is doing a bit better - but is still in fourth place among 11 sectors in 2024. Conclusion After being down by 2% at mid-year, Real Estate stocks have made all their progress in the two months to date of the third quarter. Utilities are the more clearly perceived winner from rate cuts, and they have been rising for most of 2024. On a full-year basis, and using the iShares Dow Jones sector REITs, Utilities are the second-best sector for 2024; they lag only Information Technology and are currently a few ticks ahead of Communication Services.  Four sectors are beating the market in 2024: Information Technology, Utilities, Communication Services, and Financial. While that may not sound like much in an 11-sector market, it is better than in 2023, when three sectors (Information Technology, Communication Services, and Consumer Discretionary) bested the S&P 500 total return of 25%. Moreover, in 2023 the three winning sectors were so dominant - up 66%, 44%, and 35%, respectively - that the other eight sectors averaged 3.4% capital appreciation for the year. In 2024, three other sectors - Healthcare, Industrial, and Staples - are all within a few percentage points of the index's 18% year-to-date gain. For the long term, portfolios and markets are healthiest when they are diversified. For a while in the current bull cycle, AI appeared to have a full-nelson lock on the market. While we do not expect the AI trade to unwind anytime soon, improved sector breadth across multiple equity sectors is a positive for preserving market momentum into year-end as well as for the years to come.",

As well, much of the AI development occurs within laboratories and at universities - and results are measured in tangible progress against AI objectives, not dollars or units of output. In the corporate world, nearly all pure-play AI companies service micro-niches, have little measurable revenue, and are deeply unprofitable. Argus believes that much of the revenue and most of the profitability from the AI industry is attributable to several giant U.S. and a few international companies. These primarily operate in growth sectors such as Technology, Communication Services, and Consumer Discretionary. Key companies include Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Meta Platforms, IBM, Alphabet, Salesforce, Nvidia, and Qualcomm in the U.S. China has Baidu, Tencent, and Alibaba all developing AI solutions. There is also significant activity among companies pursuing advances in IoT, vehicle electrification, autonomous driving, automation, and connectivity for manufacturing, warehousing, construction, and other areas. Argus has derived a model of the size and scope of the global AI industry, based on our coverage of major publicly traded players and most of the mid-tier players, along with our industry knowledge of private players. We estimate the global industry annual revenue amounted to $90-$100 billion in 2021, and expect that to grow at a 40% CAGR through 2030, when it is expected to reach $1.8 trillion. Annual growth is expected to decelerate from the low- to mid-40% range in the immediate years, to the mid-30% range for years toward the end of the survey period.",

Argus has derived a model of the size and scope of the global AI industry, based on our coverage of the major publicly-traded players and most of the mid-tier players, along with our industry analysts' knowledge of private players. We estimate the global AI industry amounted to about $90-$100 billion in 2021, and expect it to grow at a 40% CAGR through 2030, when it is expected to reach $1.8 trillion in annual revenue. We expect annual growth to decelerate from the low- to mid-40% range in immediate years to the mid-30% range for years toward the end of the survey period. But determining a realistic estimate for the size of the industry is a challenge. Even for an industry that promises to redefine measuring tools, there is no measurable unit of AI output comparable to barrels of oil or tons of steel. As well, much of AI development occurs within labs and at universities, and the output is measured in tangible progress against objectives, not dollars or units of output. In the corporate world, nearly all the AI pure-play companies service micro-niches, have little measurable revenue, and are deeply unprofitable. For our list this week, we take a big picture view of three areas where AI applications are developing. In Big Tech, we believe much of the revenue and most of the profitability from AI is attributable to several giant U.S. and a few international companies that operate primarily in growth sectors such as Technology, Communication Services, and Consumer Discretionary. Next, we note that China is also a hub of AI development, with companies like Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent (though Argus follows only Alibaba). Finally, Niche Tech has significant AI activity among companies pursuing advances in IoT, vehicle electrification, autonomous driving, automation and connectivity solutions for manufacturing, warehousing, construction, and other areas.

As of the end of 1Q23, the best-performing sectors for 2023 year-to-date were Technology (up 22%), Communication Services (up 20%), and Consumer Discretionary (up 16%). At the bottom of the year-to-date performance board are 2022's actual and relative winners. Energy was down 5.5% year-to-date as of the end-of-March. Several defensive sectors were negative, including declines of about 5% for Healthcare and 4% for Utilities. Financial Services, which had been up 6% at mid-month March, ended the first quarter down 6% on contagion risk. In our experience, growth sector leadership tends to anticipate recovery in the broader market. In the 2008-09 period, the S&P 500 bottomed in March 2009. Most Technology stocks in Argus coverage, however, began to turn up in November-December of 2008. A similar pattern emerged exiting the 2000-2002 \"dot.com\" implosion and 9/11 period: tech stocks put in lows in fall 2002 before the broad market began to move higher in March 2003 as the first Iraq War kicked off. After a double-digit percentage decline for stocks in 2022, Argus is modeling more-normal returns in 2023, suggesting S&P 500 appreciation in high-single-digit to low-double-digit percentages. A normally advancing market usually is led by growth sectors. But investors have become used to buying cyclical, defensive, interest-rate-sensitive, and inflation-beneficiary stocks.
