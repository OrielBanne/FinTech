# RL Trading System Development Plan- [X] 1. Collect Financial Data
    - [X] Identify data sources (APIs, providers, web scraping)
    - [X] Define required data types (prices, volume, fundamentals, indicators)
    - [X] Specify assets/markets of interest (AAPL, GOOG, ^GSPC, NVDA)
    - [X] Determine historical data range (5 years)
    - [X] Implement data collection scripts/processes
    - [X] Store collected data
- [X] 2. Preprocess and Analyze Data
    - [X] Clean data (handle missing values, outliers)
    - [X] Feature engineering (create relevant indicators, transformations)
    - [X] Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (Initial indicators calculated)
    - [X] Prepare data for RL environment (state representation) (CSV files ready)
- [X] 3. Design RL Trading Algorithm
    - [X] Define RL environment (state space, action space, reward function)
    - [X] Choose appropriate RL algorithm (e.g., PPO, DDPG, SAC)
    - [X] Design agent architecture (neural network structure)
    - [ ] Implement RL environment and agent using a framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Stable Baselines3)
    - [ ] Train the agent using historical data
    - [ ] Tune hyperparameters
- [ ] 5. Backtest Trading Strategy
    - [ ] Implement backtesting engine
    - [ ] Evaluate strategy performance (metrics: Sharpe ratio, drawdown, P&L)
    - [ ] Compare against benchmarks
    - [ ] Refine strategy based on backtesting results
- [ ] 6. Connect to Trading Platforms
    - [ ] Research broker APIs (e.g., Interactive Brokers, Alpaca)
    - [ ] Implement API integration for order execution and account management
    - [ ] Handle real-time data feeds
    - [ ] Ensure secure connection and error handling
- [ ] 7. Deploy and Monitor System
    - [ ] Set up deployment environment (cloud, local server)
    - [ ] Implement monitoring tools (performance, errors, logs)
    - [ ] Establish risk management protocols
    - [ ] Consider paper trading before live deployment
- [ ] 8. Document System Architecture
    - [ ] Document data pipeline, model design, backtesting results, deployment setup
    - [ ] Create user guide/manual if applicable
