          "reportTitle": "Which of the market-dominant and so-called \"Magnificent 7\" stocks might be the best investments? During the first phase of unbridled AI enthusiasm, all of the Mag 7 were loved as their opportunity appeared to be almost unlimited. The market is now more skeptical toward perceived AI winners, which has led to a natural tendency to rank the group on their go-forward prospects. We see Amazon moving up in the ranks, while Nvidia continues to command the top spot.  All the Mag 7 names have something in common. They are all dominant in at least one core competency; and they have leveraged the immense cash flows thrown off by their core competencies to invest in and develop the generative AI opportunity. \"Ranking\" the Mag 7 on their intermediate-term prospects, therefore, involves assessing each company's ability to defend and nurture its core business while using that strength to gain share within the AI ecosystem. For this week's list, we analyze and rank the Mag 7 (from top to bottom) on their apparent intermediate-term prospects. We expect our rankings for the Mag 7 to be fluid, but do not foresee any movement in first or last place.* Nvidia (NVDA): We continue to put Nvidia at the top of the Mag 7 list. Unlike the other six names, Nvidia's core competency is artificial intelligence. The need for realistic rendering in GPU-based gaming, Nvidia's founding business, laid the groundwork for the applications acceleration and the massively parallel computing that are cornerstones of training large language models (LLMs) and enabling inference. We rank Nvidia number one based on the evidence in the company's own growth numbers, which are stellar. In its recent fiscal 4Q25, revenue of $39 billion grew 78% annually. At its GTC event in March 2025, Nvidia forecast that data-center revenue would exceed $1 trillion annually in the next few years, and that the entire global industrial infrastructure represented a $50 trillion opportunity for AI renewal. Nvidia also provides much more than its industry leading GPUs, including its CUDA software library, and is \"turbo-charging\" agentic AI development with open-reasoning models, platforms, and partnerships. The best evidence of Nvidia's momentum is the growth of the enterprise infrastructure companies using Nvidia solutions to support the mainstreaming of AI. Micron's data-center revenue tripled year over year and now exceeds 50% of total company revenue. Micron increased the TAM for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) opportunity to $35 billion as of March 2025, up from $20 billion approximately half a year ago. Among the leading U.S.-based GPU server providers, Dell Technologies posted $10 billion in AI sever revenue in FY25 and expects $15 billion in FY26. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise exited fiscal 1Q25 with $8.3 billion in cumulative AI systems and services orders. The leaders in data center interconnects (DCIs), Broadcom and Marvell, are both reporting explosive growth in these categories. * Meta Platforms (META): Meta Platforms in second place because it has been among the most successful in leveraging its core competency (social media) into a leadership role in building LLMs, including multi-modal models. Snap has a limited opportunity, and X is stunted by self-inflicted wounds and perceived Musk contagion. Only Asia-based companies such as ByteDance (TikTok) represent a real threat. We see some risk to the core business from seemingly endless EU and U.S. congressional opposition; and Meta's social-media cornerstones (Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp) could be carved cleanly in three. We do not see that happening, however. Meta has successfully pivoted from the Zuckerberg's expensive obsession with the metaverse to the more-practical and fast-developing AI opportunity. Unlike AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, Meta is successfully enabling and advancing leading LLMs even though it is not a major provider of hybrid cloud services. We see Meta first and foremost deploying AI internally to improve operating efficiency and personal targeting so as to optimize the company's social media user base, which exceeds 3.3 billion. Facebook Reality Labs, which houses Meta's Gen AI business, posted revenue of $2.1 billion in 2024, just 1% of total Meta revenue. Currently, this is mainly a hardware-based business (Quest VR headsets, Ray-Ban AR glasses), but we see long-term growth opportunity as Meta's Llama LLMs go mainstream. Much as Apple capitalized on the vast iOS installed base and targeted the individual with iCloud, Meta could offer a personalized AI offering to its more-than three billion users.* Amazon.com (AMZN): In third place is Amazon. Amazon's online retail operations and particularly its Prime business are without a global peer. The combined retail operating margin (Americas and International) for 4Q24 was 6.1%, by far the highest in our model going back to company's inception. Prime's media is now rivaling Netflix in content quality and volume.  AWS is the leading CSP globally, and its rising margins and cash flows are funding the company's Gen AI opportunity. Amazon was quick to replace the head of AWS in May 2024 when the board perceived that the company was lagging in Gen AI. AWS is at a $110 billion annual revenue run rate and margins are at or near record highs. Both internally and in partnership with Anthropic and others, AI has produced Bedrock Marketplace, where clients can choose from over 100 LLMs; Trainium and Trainium 2 accelerators; and Amazon Nova, an extensive family of foundational models. * Apple (AAPL): Fourth place goes to Apple. Apple's core competency is global leadership in technology devices and services. Apple has been somewhat disappointing in its early efforts in AI. The company is even going outside its usual reliance on internal capabilities to enlist support from companies such as OpenAI. But we have long regarded Apple as a product perfector, not a product pioneer; early iteration mobile phones such as DynaTAC and StarTAC amazed, but they are long gone while iPhone grows in dominance. Investors are also concerned about Apple's declining China sales. Yet in the most-recent fiscal 1Q25, Apple grew revenue in all other regions. The company's massive iOS installed base exceeds 2.2 billion, providing fertile ground for continued growth in services.* Microsoft (MSFT): In the fifth spot is Microsoft. Microsoft has leveraged is core competency in enterprise software into Azure, the number two CSP behind AWS. Like all of the companies mentioned above that are not named Nvidia, Microsoft is challenged in getting sufficient supply of advanced Blackwell products to build and run its most-advanced models. Microsoft's cloud business has never been as profitable as AWS, although that may partly be due to which assets are allocated to the cloud division. Microsoft has had a few missteps in rolling out its Gen AI models, and both CNBC and Invezz recently questioned whether Microsoft was becoming an AI laggard. We note, however, that Microsoft Copilot has seen meaningful share gains and represents the first real threat to our sixth-place company.* Alphabet (GOOGL): Ranked sixth is Alphabet. Alphabet, of course, used to be named Google, and that name has been synonymous with internet search for decades. AI-assisted products such as Copilot and OpenAI's SearchGPT may be starting to cut into Google's search dominance. With many enterprises and consumers using Microsoft Edge as their browsers, Copilot \"conveniently\" pops up atop many searches. Google is seen as a pioneer in AI, created technologies underpinning early LLMs, and was a leader in the space until OpenAI exploded on the scene. After the hasty and flubbed Bard launch, Google Cloud has done much better with Gemini. Alphabet, like Meta, has been a particular target of U.S. and EU regulators. In August 2024, Alphabet was named a monopolist in a case brought by the Justice Department and 37 states. Breaking up Alphabet, however, would cleave the one big profitable business of Google Search and perhaps YouTube from all the expensive and unprofitable growth areas in Other Bets, including Waymo, Google Cloud, and the AI initiative. * Tesla (TSLA): At the tail end of the Mag 7 ranking is Tesla, whose core competency is electric vehicles. This space is becoming crowded, and China's BYD is much bigger and has developed fast-charging technology that is currently unmatched. The U.S. under President Biden sought to protect Tesla and U.S. EVs with massive tariffs on EV imports. Tesla CEO Elon Musk and President Trump are in sync, although the current president previously disparaged EVs in favor of internal combustion engines (ICE) vehicles. Tesla, like X (the former Twitter), is suffering some level of Musk contagion, although the number of users reselling their cars due to perceptions about Musk is not yet a major impediment. Instead, we see Tesla at risk from commoditization of EVs and competition from rivals, both domestic and foreign. While we did not incorporate valuation into our rankings, these companies are not hugely expensive due to the recent correction in growth sectors and the generally strong operating prospects for core businesses.",

Yet it's not a full trading week as markets will be closed on Thursday, which is a National Day of Mourning for former President Jimmy Carter. Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6%, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq both dropped 0.5%. Over the two days of trading so far in 2025, the Dow is higher by 0.44%, the S&P is up 1%, and the Nasdaq has popped 2%. On the economic calendar, the big day this week is Friday, with the December jobs report due from the Labor Department. In December, Nonfarm Payrolls clocked in at 227,000. For January, the consensus is 150,000. Our forecast is 125,000. The Unemployment Rate was 4.2% in December, and is not expected to change. In other economic news, Factory Orders will be reported on Monday; Job Openings and the Trade Deficit on Tuesday; and the private payrolls ADP employment report and the minutes of the last Federal Reserve rate meeting will be released on Wednesday.  Argus Chief Economist Chris Graja's Call of the Week is the Average Hourly Earnings component of the jobs report, on which Chris offered the following: 'Average hourly earnings shouldn't be overlooked. The Street and Argus are looking for 4% growth. That's good news for workers. But how does a FOMC member reconcile 4% wage growth with 2% inflation target? The answer is labor productivity that grew a strong 2.2% in 3Q. When workers are producing more, they can be paid more without stoking inflation. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell actually addressed the issue in his press conference after the last FOMC meeting. He said that wages are 'still a bit above what would be sustainable if productivity were to revert to its longer-run trend.' But he added that 'if you take into account the high productivity readings we've had, then wages are already at a sustainable level relative to 2% inflation.' The next quarterly report on labor productivity is due on February 6. The 20-year average is about 1.7%.'  The new earnings season kicks off in mid-January, with the big banks reporting first. For 2025, Argus forecasts 12% EPS growth for S&P 500 companies. This follows a higher-than-expected 9% for 2024. There are a few companies on the earnings calendar this week, including Jefferies Financial Group and Albertsons on Wednesday; and Delta Air Lines, Constellation Brands, and Walgreens Boots Alliance on Friday. Also on the corporate front, the Consumer Electronics Show, or CES, is this week in Las Vegas, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang slated to speak. Last week, mortgage rates inched closer to 7% and climbed another 6 basis points (bps), with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage now at 6.91%, according to FreddieMac. Gas prices dropped two cents, with the average price of regular gas now at $3.00 per gallon. The Atlanta Fed GDPNow indicator is forecasting for 4Q and calls for expansion of 2.4%. The Cleveland Fed CPINow indicator is forecasting for December and is at 2.86%. Looking ahead, the Federal Reserve meets again at the end of January, with a rate decision on January 29. Odds for a rate cut at that meeting are at 11%, according to the CME FedWatch rate tool. The next rate decision after that comes on March 19.",

At the same time, large speculators (hedge funds, momentum junkies) are extremely bullish in their futures positions. Large specs tend to be right during a big part of moves higher and lower, but are mostly wrong at major turning points.   In the commodity world, the COT data remains bearish for gold and silver but is fairly bullish for copper. Data remains bullish for the U.S. dollar as well as the euro, but fairly bearish for the yen. It is quite bullish for natural gas and mildly bullish for WTI. (Mark Arbeter, CMT)",

Once again, breadth was good and leadership was provided by the S&P 600 Small-Caps, which popped 1.8%, and the S&P 400 Mid-Caps, which tacked on 1.5%. The most-concentrated mega-cap indices -- such as the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) and S&P 100 -- lagged again, posting only minor gains.   A few markets moved quite a bit, with the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) rising 2.5% and the 10-year yield dropping about 15 basis points to 4.26%. We previously suggested that the 10-year had reached an important level and a possible inflection point -- and with yesterday's action, we got our confirmation. Gold and silver futures plunged over 3%, while Bitcoin also fell over 3% to below $95,000; as expected, the big round number of $100,000 has provided a ceiling.     Looking at a few of pieces of option data, the OEX open-interest ratio, which is total put open-interest divided by total call open-interest, remains very low. This is a non-contrarian sentiment indicator, as OEX option traders usually are quite good at identifying turning points in the market. When this ratio rises, OEX traders are becoming more bearish and vice versa -- and it's often a good idea to follow these astute investors.   The CBOE equity-only put/call ratio is a contrarian sentiment reading, and the five-day has been very low for over the past two months, indicating a big appetite by smaller investors for call options. While this is concerning, generally we do not get a pullback or a correction until these investors re-verse course. (Mark Arbeter, CMT)",

          "title": "The stock market continues to push higher, although the S&P 500 (SPX) failed to hold 6,000 for the fifth time since November 8. Once again, breadth was good and leadership was provided by the S&P 600 Small-Caps, which popped 1.8%, and the S&P 400 Mid-Caps, which tacked on 1.5%. The most-concentrated mega-cap indices -- such as the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) and S&P 100 -- lagged again, posting only minor gains.   A few markets moved quite a bit, with the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) rising 2.5% and the 10-year yield dropping about 15 basis points to 4.26%. We previously suggested that the 10-year had reached an important level and a possible inflection point -- and with yesterday's action, we got our confirmation. Gold and silver futures plunged over 3%, while Bitcoin also fell over 3% to below $95,000; as expected, the big round number of $100,000 has provided a ceiling.     Looking at a few of pieces of option data, the OEX open-interest ratio, which is total put open-interest divided by total call open-interest, remains very low. This is a non-contrarian sentiment indicator, as OEX option traders usually are quite good at identifying turning points in the market. When this ratio rises, OEX traders are becoming more bearish and vice versa -- and it's often a good idea to follow these astute investors.   The CBOE equity-only put/call ratio is a contrarian sentiment reading, and the five-day has been very low for over the past two months, indicating a big appetite by smaller investors for call options. While this is concerning, generally we do not get a pullback or a correction until these investors re-verse course. (Mark Arbeter, CMT)"

November usually starts off at a fast pace, as nonfarm payrolls are reported and many companies are still reporting 3Q earnings. This year, the Fed meets this week and will likely lower rates again.

          "reportTitle": "The last Monday of August was a mixed bag. The Nasdaq and the Nasdaq 100 were dragged down from the start due to a tough day for semiconductors. The iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) fell 2.5% and is sitting on short-term support from its 10- and 21-day exponential moving averages. The SOXX has had a nice recovery since the August 5 intraday low -- and with Nvidia reporting after Wednesday's close, it's not surprising that some anxiety is building in front of the numbers. Discretionary also fell due to weakness in Tesla.  Energy led the 11 S&P 500 sectors, as crude oil (WTI) bounced for a third day. Crude is back up to $77/barrel from a low last week of $71.46. The oil chart is a mess, with prices chopping around from the low $60s to the mid-$90s since the summer of 2022. Other sector strength was seen from the defensive Staples and Utilities groups, with minor gains in Materials, Financials, and Communication Services.   A fair amount of people in the financial world have said that the S&P 500's almost full recovery from the pullback in the second half of July into early August has been too fast. But quick recoveries and \"V\" bottoms generally are quite bullish and often lead to additional all-time highs. On the weekly charts, we had quick recoveries in the latter part of 2023 and in April/May of this year. And let's not forget the recovery from the pandemic, the recovery in early 2019, the recovery in 2014, and the several recoveries in 2012. (Mark Arbeter, CMT)",

BlackRock CEO Lawrence Fink, who oversees approximately $9 trillion in assets, announced in January 2020 that his firm would be investing in companies that are making progress on sustainability. He doubled down in his January 2021 letter, calling on company managements to disclose their plans for making their businesses \"compatible with a net-zero economy\" by 2050. As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Impact Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, focused at first on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. Performance of these initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across all industries that can have an \"impact\" on global issues such as climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers' rights.",

On the positive side, the consumer appears to be in good shape, with Personal Consumption Expenditures expanding at a 1%-2% pace, driven by spending on Services.

Argus has derived a model of the size and scope of the global AI industry, based on our coverage of the major publicly-traded players and most of the mid-tier players, along with our industry analysts' knowledge of private players. We estimate the global AI industry amounted to about $90-$100 billion in 2021, and expect it to grow at a 40% CAGR through 2030, when it is expected to reach $1.8 trillion in annual revenue. We expect annual growth to decelerate from the low- to mid-40% range in immediate years to the mid-30% range for years toward the end of the survey period. But determining a realistic estimate for the size of the industry is a challenge. Even for an industry that promises to redefine measuring tools, there is no measurable unit of AI output comparable to barrels of oil or tons of steel. As well, much of AI development occurs within labs and at universities, and the output is measured in tangible progress against objectives, not dollars or units of output. In the corporate world, nearly all the AI pure-play companies service micro-niches, have little measurable revenue, and are deeply unprofitable. For our list this week, we take a big picture view of three areas where AI applications are developing. In Big Tech, we believe much of the revenue and most of the profitability from AI is attributable to several giant U.S. and a few international companies that operate primarily in growth sectors such as Technology, Communication Services, and Consumer Discretionary. Next, we note that China is also a hub of AI development, with companies like Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent (though Argus follows only Alibaba).

We think that will hold steady, though we note that any surprise is likely to occur on the upside. As is typically the case, the report will indicate areas of strength and weakness in the economy. On the positive side, the consumer appears to be in good shape, with Personal Consumption Expenditures expanding at a 1%-2% pace, driven by spending on services and, more recently, on durable goods. Companies continue to invest in R&D projects and software, as investments into intellectual property are advancing at a high-single-digit rate. Government spending has picked up as well. On the downside, residential investment has declined sharply as interest rates have risen, though the sector seems to be bottoming; and exports of goods have been challenged by the strong dollar. The GDP report also includes an inflation measure, the PCE Price Index. This index, excluding food and energy, is rising at a 5.0% pace, well ahead the Federal Reserve's inflation target of 2.0%. We don't expect the results of this report to move the markets much, as the data is almost three months old.  The first report on 2Q23 GDP will come out in late July. The current reading of the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow indicator is 1.9%. The current Argus forecast, last published in our Viewpoint report, is a bit more aggressive at 2.5%, due in part to expectations for continued consumer sector strength.",

On the positive side, the consumer appears to be in good shape, with Personal Consumption Expenditures expanding at a 1%-2% pace, driven by spending on Services. Companies continue to invest in R&D projects and software, as Investments into Intellectual Property are advancing at a high-single-digit rate. Government spending has picked up as well. On the downside, Residential Investment has declined sharply as interest rates increased; Consumer Spending on Durable Goods has been lower due to supply-chain problems in the auto sector; and Exports of Goods have been challenged by the strong dollar.  The GDP report also includes an inflation measure, the PCE Price Index.  This index, excluding food and energy, is rising at a 4.3% pace, well ahead the Federal Reserve's inflation target of 2.0%. We don't expect the results of this report to move the markets much, as the data is already almost three months old. The first report on 1Q23 GDP will come out later in April.  The current reading of the Atlanta Fed's GDP Now indicator is 3.2%. The current Argus forecast, last published in our Viewpoint report, is more conservative at 1.3%, due in part to a forecast pullback in inventory building.",

If U.S. corporations weren't innovating, creating new products (such as vaccines) and services and moving into new markets and applications, the domestic economy would not be growing, and capital would not be flooding into the country. Consider that U.S. GDP was approximately $1 trillion in 1930 but was more than $24 trillion at the end of 2021. That's growth of 24-times. Meanwhile, the U.S. population has grown less than three-times during that time span, to 320 million from 120 million. The delta between GDP growth and population growth has been driven, in large part, by innovation.",
